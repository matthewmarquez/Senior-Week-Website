       <h1><center>Registration</center></h1>

       <p>Registration for Senior Week 2019 will open on April 1 and be due on April 10 at 5 PM. The registration form will contain the lottery. A link to the registration form will be found here once it's available. The interest form is no longer available as it closed at the end of February.</p>

       <p>Senior Week will be hosting a spring study break on April 4 from 7-9 PM to help explain registration and answer any questions. Stay tuned for details!</p>

       <br> 
       
       <h2>Subsidies</h2>

       <p>We hope that all those eligible for Senior Week can participate without worrying about finances. There are free tickets available for Senior Week events. For any events that do not involve alcohol, we are setting aside a limited number of FREE tickets for each event. Since these tickets are limited, they will be available on a first-come, first-served basis. If your financial resources are very limited and you cannot afford tickets, we invite you sign up for the ARM Coalition (Accessing Resources MIT) roster. 

        To be eligible for FREE tickets, sign up for the ARM Coalition Roster by clicking this link: <a href="https://engage.mit.edu/organization/arm">https://engage.mit.edu/organization/arm</a>. 
        
        Next, click on the blue box that says “Sign In” , and then click on the blue box that says “Join”. From this roster, we will then add your name to the AdMITOne ticketing system for any FREE tickets that are available. 
        
        Once you are on the ARM Coalition roster, your name will be entered into the AdMITOne ticketing system, and you will be able to select the FREE ARM Coalition ticket as an option in AdMITOne. Please be considerate of your peers, and only request FREE tickets if you really need them! For any additional questions about the ARM Coalition roster, just contact <a href="mailto:arm-coalition@mit.edu">arm-coalition@mit.edu</a>. The ARM Coalition oversees distribution of subsidies. Your information will only be shared with the ARM Coalition and not the Senior Week committee.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h2>Refund and Cancellation Policy</h2>

        <P>If an event participant cancels their registration before April 29, they will be eligible for a full refund. After that date, refunds are not guaranteed. The Senior Week committee will attempt to give the spot to another student, and, should the committee be successful in finding another student, the cancelling student will be given a full refund. 
          If the Senior Week committee is unable to find a student to replace the student cancelling, the Senior Week committee will attempt to cancel the spot and get a refund with the primary event vendor. 
          Should they succeed in cancelling and obtaining a refund, the student will receive the refund provided that the refund does not exceed the per person cost the venue charged Senior Week or the ticket price. 
          The maximum amount Senior Week will refund a participant is the minimum of the ticket price, the primary event cost per person, and the amount refunded to Senior Week by the vendor. Senior Week will not request refunds from any additional vendors that were used for an event, including the transportation provider. 
          Participants can only receive refunds for the parts of their ticket that went towards the primary event vendor and for events that had primary event vendors (some events do not have primary event vendors). 
          Senior Week participants may request a list of events with primary event vendors along with their respective primary event vendors by emailing the Senior Week committee. 
          <b>Senior Week does not guarantee refunds after April 29, so any refunds issued are at the discretion of the committee (according to the guidelines above) and should not be expected.</b></p>

          <p>Senior Week tickets may not be bought, sold, or transferred. If a participant no longer wants to use their ticket, they should inform the committee. Ticket redistribution will be handled by the committee.
          </P>
