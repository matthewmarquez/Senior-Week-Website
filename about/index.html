       <h1><center>About</center></h1>

       <p>Senior Week is exactly what it sounds like - it's a week of fun events designed for MIT seniors to celebrate their achievements and connect them
       with their classmates one last time before graduation. Senior Week takes place
       during the period leading up to graduation. For the class of 2019, Senior Week is May 31-June 5, 2019.</p>
       <p>Senior Week typically consists of a kickoff event, a series of mid-week events (both free and paid), and a senior toast. More information about events will become available later this semester and will be on the <a href="../events">Events</a> page. Some mid-week events have no limit on the number of attendees, while others have an attendance cap.
         To be considered for an event with a participation cap, you must enter the Senior Week lottery. There is a single lottery for all limited participation events with the exception of the two trip events (Cape Cod Trip and Casino Trip). The two trip events will have their own lotteries. More information about the
         Senior Week lottery can be found on the <a href="../lottery">Lottery</a> page. All members of the class of 2019 are permitted to enter the lottery, and events without participation caps are open to the entire class.</p>
         <p>For more dates and the registration form, please visit the <a href="../registration">Registration</a> page. The mandatory interest form is no longer available and closed in February. All three lotteries (the main lottery and the two trip lotteries) will be available on the registration form and due on April 10 at 5 PM.</p>
       </p>
       <h2>Eligibility</h2>
       <p>For the purposes of Senior Week, anyone who was originally part of the class of 2019 (enterted MIT in September 2015), received a degree from MIT in February 2019, or will receive a degree from MIT in June 2019 is considered a member of the class of 2019 and is eligible to participate in Senior Week. </p>
       <h2>Committee</h2>
       <p>Senior Week is largely student-run. The Senior Week committee, a class committee, organizes Senior Week. Senior Week receives funds from the class and the Alumni Association. More information about the Senior Week committee can be found on the <a href="../committee">Committee</a> page. You can contact the committee by going to the <a href="../contact">Contact</a> page.</p>
       <h2>Subsidies</h2>
       <p>Subsidies are available for Senior Week! You can read more about this on the <a href="https://seniorweek.mit.edu/registration">Registration</a> page.</p>
